Skill Test for Elebram (Creating Web Sales Using Odoo-14)

Before you can install this web sales module, there are a few things that need to be prepared: 
- Python (*Here I use python 3.6.5)
- Postgres
- Source Odoo 14

When the third is available then the next step is
- Copy the module folder into the Odoo addons directory or Can create a new folder in the Directory Odoo 14.
- Make sure that the directory path is already listed in the configuration file of Odoo.
- Run the odoo service
- Go to the "Debug" Odoo menu

- Go into the "Apps" menu
- Click on the "Update App List" Menu
